### Introduction

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of financial markets. Deep learning techniques have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to capture intricate patterns and relationships in data. This repository investigates the performance of various deep learning models in predicting stock prices, aiming to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

### Models

The repository currently includes the following deep learning models for stock price prediction:

**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** - A popular recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that can capture long-term dependencies in time series data.
**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** - Typically used for image processing tasks, CNNs can also be applied to sequential data like stock prices by treating them as images.
**Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** - Similar to LSTM, GRU is another type of recurrent neural network that can model sequential data effectively.
Datasets
**ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** is one of the earlier popular time series forecasting model that combines the autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) components to capture both the trend and seasonality in a time series data, making it suitable for predicting future values based on past observations.

To evaluate the performance of the deep learning models, several publicly available stock price datasets can be used. The repository provides instructions and scripts to download and preprocess these datasets, ensuring a consistent and standardized input format for all models.
